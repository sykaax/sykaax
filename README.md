### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a programmer who is focused on full stack development of html, css, php, js, mysql, c++, TypeScript as well as frameworks like node, tailwind, react, angular, ajax. At the moment I am studying at school for adults to go to college and receive further formal education, despite the abundance of my skills and experience, I have never received a formal education.

If you wanna hire me in part time but so that I don't have problems studying at an adult school when contact me, but remember i spend about 7 hours' per day in education and could spend maximum 3h on work, not more.

I'm interested in interface development.

Also in optimizing the backend code to increase server response speed.
